I've completed my second project and I'm again really happy with how it turned out. Compared to the CLI project, creating a program using Sinatra was more engaging because I was able to see my app as a website. Prior to project week, I had a general idea of how Sinatra and ActiveRecord worked, however, my foundation was no where near solid. When it came time to plan out how I would build my project, let alone figure out what my idea would be, I became overwhelmed. Ultimately, I knew that the best way that I could set myself up for success was by focusing on building out one piece of the application at a time. 

This approach allowed me to plan out a daily project goal of where I wanted to be by the end of the day. It established a system of achieving small wins each day and helped me focus on completing the project. For example, my goal for the first day was to build out all of the seven restful routes of my songs controller and be able to navigate to them successfully. Once I completed that, the next day I focused on how users can create an account and then log in and out of the website. After completing that, the next day I focused on how users could create songs once they have an account and then be able to view their songs. This pattern continued all the way until the point of completion where I was satisfied with how my project looked and operated. Breaking down the project into daily goals helped me establish a solid plan to achieving my end result.

Each goal came with its series of challenges but it made for the best learning experience. In Sinatra, many of problems I ran into had a similar approach for solving them. Since each http request is independent of the previous one, it was always a great starting point to go back to the last request that was working and start to debug from there. This is one thing that I learned and was necessary, especially when I wanted to render an erb view. Another important part of the project was allowing the user to be able to edit their songs and not other user's songs. This is a essential piece to any website and it was certainly the most rewarding part of the project for me. Working through this goal brought into focus several topics like conditional statements, redirects, erb views and helper methods. It taught me to challenge my code and made me determined to have my app running as smoothly as possible. Any time my app broke, I went in and looked for ways to get it back up and running whether that was through redirect or rendering an error erb. 

Nearly a week later and I now have a project that I can show for it. More importantly, I have a much better understanding of how Sinatra and ActiveRecord operates. Working on this project has been the best learning experience I've had so far in the program. It has challenged me to constantly ask "why?" when something works or doesn't work and taught me to use a different approach when something isn't working. Looking forward to the next project!
