For as long as I can remember, I have always thought of myself as being tech-savvy. Problem-solving on the computer comes naturally to me and you can bet that whenever my parents have computer/phone issues, they call on me to solve them. 

Like most Flatiron students, my background is in an area other than computer science. I studied accounting in college and although my courses were rigorous, I enjoyed the challenge of learning the material and overall found it very interesting. However, after working in the accounting field for over two years, I knew this line of work wasn't meant for me. I wanted something more where I could combine my love for computers with my creativity. 

One day, I came across a LinkedIn profile of someone my age with a similar background in business, who was now working as a Software Engineer. He showcased a website on his profile that he built from scratch. Intrigued, I clicked on the link to check it out. Needless to say, I was blown away. In that moment, I thought to myself, "That's so cool! Why can't I do that?" It was a total moment of clarity and I immediately started to look up the best software engineering programs I could enroll in.

I decided to study software engineering because ultimately I want to develop an awesome skill, have a career doing something that I am excited about and be able to express my creativity through my work.
